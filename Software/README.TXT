The software and scripts included are laid out in sub-directories for each chapter of
the book.  The T-SQL scripts and other source code are saved in numbered files.  This 
is the structure of the directory:

SOFTWARE
   |
   +-----README.TXT file
   |
   +-----CHAPTER 1
   |         |
   |         +------vb Subdirectory contains Visual Basic source code
   |         +------cs Subdirectory contains C# source code
   |         +------.SQL Script Files
   |
   +-----CHAPTER 2
   |         |
   |         +------.SQL Script Files
   .
   .
   .

Directories are divided and labeled by chapter number.  Each chapter contains T-SQL
script source code files that can be run in SSMS.  A chapter may also contain Visual
Basic or C# source code.  If a chapter has available VB source code, it is in a sub-
directory named 'vb' under the chapter directory.  Any available C# source code is
in a sub-directory named 'cs' under the chapter directory.

All listings are named to match their name in the book.  For instance, Listing1-2.SQL
corresponds to the listing labeled "Listing 1-2" in Chapter 1.  The sub-directory 
"vb\Listing11-22" contains the Visual Studio project for the VB version of the listing
labeled "Listing 11-22" in Chapter 11.

All of the source code available in this book (Pro T-SQL 2005 Programmer's Guide, ISBN
1-59059-794-X) is available from the Apress website (http://www.apress.com), in the
Source Code area.
